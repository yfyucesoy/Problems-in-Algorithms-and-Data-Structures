I return from abroad home.
I bring a computer, and a labtop with me.
I wish I also had a projector.
But the projector was quite big.
So I could not take it with me.
What if I had taken a router with me?
A switch maybe?
A hub? Nee, hubs have become things of the past.
No hub is being used in today's networks.
A fiber channel network is likely to be found in
a distributed file system.
Was ist los mit dir?
Bist du verruct geworden?
Du idiot!
